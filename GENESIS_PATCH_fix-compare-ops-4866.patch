Okay, so I'm looking at this issue on GitHub for the TensorTorrent project. The problem is that when someone tries to run a test using `pytest tests/`, they're getting an error: "ImportError: cannot import name 'get_shard_shape' from 'tensortorrent.utils'". Hmm, that means the function get_shard_shape isn't being found where it's supposed to be.

First, I need to figure out why this is happening. Maybe the function was recently moved or renamed? Let me check the codebase. Oh, wait! It looks like the function get_shard_shape might have been moved into a new module, maybe something related to distributed training since that's a common area for such functions.

So, in the test file tests/utils.py, when they try to import get_shard_shape from tensortorrent.utils, it can't find it anymore. That makes sense if the function was moved elsewhere. I should update the import statement to reflect its new location. Let me see where else this function might be. Perhaps in a module like utils.distributed or something similar.

Alternatively, maybe the function was part of a refactoring and is now inside another class or module. If that's the case, the test needs to import it from there instead. I'll need to adjust the import path accordingly.

Another possibility is that the function was removed entirely, but that seems less likely since the issue mentions trying to fix it, implying the function still exists just in a different place.

Once I've updated the import statement in the test file to point to the correct module where get_shard_shape resides, running pytest again should resolve the ImportError. It's also a good idea to check if there are any other tests or parts of the codebase that might be affected by this change and update them as needed.

In summary, the main steps are:
1. Identify the new location of get_shard_shape.
2. Update the import statement in the test file.
3. Run the tests again to confirm the fix works.

I should also consider if there are any dependencies or other functions that might have been moved along with get_shard_shape and ensure all necessary imports are updated to prevent similar issues elsewhere.
</think>

To fix the issue where `get_shard_shape` is not found, update the import statement in the test file. Assuming `get_shard_shape` was moved into a new module, adjust the import path accordingly.

```python
# tests/utils.py

from tensortorrent.utils.distributed import get_shard_shape
```
