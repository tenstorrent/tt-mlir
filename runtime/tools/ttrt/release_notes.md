# `ttrt`

## Overview

### Release date

June 30th, 2025

### Summary

This tool is intended to be a swiss army knife for working with flatbuffers generated by the compiler.  Its primary role is to inspect and run flatbuffer files.  It enables the running of flatbuffer files without a front-end runtime.

### Quick links

[README.md](./README.md)
[Documentation](../../../docs/src/ttrt.md)

### Features

#### Application APIs

Application API [documentation](../../../docs/src/ttrt.md#apis).

```bash
ttrt --help
ttrt read
ttrt run
ttrt query
ttrt perf
ttrt check
```

#### Runtime APIs

Runtime API [documentation](../../../docs/src/ttrt.md#bonus-section-extending-runtime-to-other-fes).

#### Multi-device support

ttrt supports working with flatbuffers not just on a single n150 device but also with multi-device setups n300, llmbox, and tg. This functionality is implemented automatically through `system_desc.ttsys` generation and exportation.

#### Standalone whls release

[Installing](../../../docs/src/ttrt.md#installing-ttrt-as-python-whls)

#### Use as python package or cmd line tool

As a [python package](../../../docs/src/ttrt.md#ttrt-as-a-python-package).
As a [command line tool](../../../docs/src/ttrt.md#command-line).

#### gdb support

`ttrt` can be relaunched inside of gdb which can be useful for debugging C++
runtime components.

## Upcoming features

TODO: Decide whether to include planned Q3 features

Q3 goals

perf supporting multiple program flatbuffers (const-eval, training graphs)
builtin hang detection and recovery
blackhole support for all APIs
more clean integration with CI and reporting to superset
ttrt/ttir-builder can dump tons of data - we should find a way to visualize all of this in superset
