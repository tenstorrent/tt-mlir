Implement the missing window reduction operation in `StableHLOToTTIRPatterns.cpp`. This involves adding a pattern matcher for the specific HLO op and implementing its corresponding logic to generate TTIR instructions. Ensure that the implementation adheres to the existing coding standards and includes necessary tests.
