# tt-mlir

tt-mlir is a compiler project aimed at defining MLIR dialects to abstract compute on Tenstorrent AI accelerators.
It is built on top of the [MLIR](https://mlir.llvm.org/) compiler infrastructure and targets [TTNN](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-metal).

For more information on the project, see https://tenstorrent.github.io/tt-mlir/.

## Project Goals

- *Generality*: Support a wide range of AI models and workloads including training
- *Scalable*: First class primitives to describe scaling to multichip systems
- *Performant*: Enable great out of the box performance
- *Tooling*: Enable human in the loop guided compiler optimization
- *Open source*: All project development is done in the open
