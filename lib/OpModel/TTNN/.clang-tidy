# Issue(vkovacevic): https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-metal/issues/35064
# Inherit from parent config but disable clang-analyzer-core.CallAndMessage
# This check produces false positives when calling tt-metal APIs that use
# C++17 structured bindings in device_operation.hpp (line 523).
# The static analyzer cannot track initialization through structured bindings.
