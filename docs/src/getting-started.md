# Getting Started

This page walks you through the steps required to build TT-MLIR from source. This is required if you want to do development work for TT-MLIR. Topics covered include:

* [Configuring Hardware](#configuring-hardware)
* [System Dependencies](#system-dependencies)
* [Environment Setup](#environment-setup)
* [Lint](#lint)
* [Pre-commit](#pre-commit)
* [Building the Docs](#building-the-docs)
* [Common Runtime Errors](#common-runtime-errors)

> **NOTE:** If you have a build issue, you can file a bug [here](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-mlir/issues).

## Configuring Hardware
Before setup can happen, you must configure your hardware. You can skip this section if you already completed the configuration steps. Otherwise, this section of the walkthrough shows you how to do a quick setup using TT-Installer.

1. Configure your hardware with TT-Installer using the [Quick Installation section here.](https://docs.tenstorrent.com/getting-started/README.html#quick-installation)

2. Reboot your machine.

3. Please ensure that after you run this script, after you complete reboot, you activate the virtual environment it sets up - ```source ~/.tenstorrent-venv/bin/activate```.

4. After your environment is running, to check that everything is configured, type the following:

```bash
tt-smi
```

You should see the Tenstorrent System Management Interface. It allows you to view real-time stats, diagnostics, and health info about your Tenstorrent device.

## System Dependencies

TT-XLA has the following system dependencies:
* Ubuntu 22.04
* Python 3.10
* python3.10-venv
* Clang 17
* GCC 11
* Ninja
* CMake 3.20 or higher

Instructions are provided for a Linux machine and also Mac OS. The runtime environment does not work on MacOS, and it is not officially supported.

Here are links to the appropriate system dependency steps depending on your system:
* [Linux Instructions for Installing Dependencies](#installing-dependencies-if-you-have-runtime-enabled)
* [MacOS Instructions for Installing Dependencies](#mac-os-instructions-for-installing-dependencies)

### Linux Instructions for Installing Dependencies

#### Installing Python
If your system already has Python installed, make sure it is Python 3.10 or higher:

```bash
python3 --version
```

If not, install Python:

```bash
sudo apt install python3
```

#### Installing CMake 4.0.3
This section walks you through installing CMake 4 or higher.

1. Install CMake 4.0.3:

```bash
pip install cmake==4.0.3
```

2. Check that the correct version of CMake is installed:

```bash
cmake --version
```

If you see ```cmake version 4.0.3``` you are ready for the next section.

#### Installing Clang 17
This section walks you through installing Clang 17.

1. Install Clang 17:

```bash
wget https://apt.llvm.org/llvm.sh
chmod u+x llvm.sh
sudo ./llvm.sh 17
sudo apt install -y libc++-17-dev libc++abi-17-dev
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/clang-17 /usr/bin/clang
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/clang++-17 /usr/bin/clang++
```

2. Check that the selected GCC candidate using Clang 17 is using 11:

```bash
clang -v
```

3. Look for the line that starts with: `Selected GCC installation:`. If it is something other than GCC 11, and you do not see GCC 11 listed as an option, please install GCC 11 using:

```bash
sudo apt-get install gcc-11 lib32stdc++-11-dev lib32gcc-11-dev
```

4. If you see GCC 12 listed as installed and listed as the default choice, uninstall it with:

```bash
sudo rm -rf /usr/bin/../lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/12
```

#### Installing Ninja
To install Ninja, do the following:

```bash
sudo apt install ninja-build
```

#### Installing Open MPI
To install Open MPI, do the following:

```bash
wget -q https://github.com/dmakoviichuk-tt/mpi-ulfm/releases/download/v5.0.7-ulfm/openmpi-ulfm_5.0.7-1_amd64.deb -O /tmp/openmpi-ulfm.deb && \
sudo apt install -y /tmp/openmpi-ulfm.deb
```

#### Installing Dependencies If You Have Runtime Enabled
If you intend to build with runtime enabled (`-DTTMLIR_ENABLE_RUNTIME=ON`), you also need to install TT-Metal dependencies which can be found [here](https://docs.tenstorrent.com/tt-metal/latest/ttnn/ttnn/installing.html#install-system-level-dependencies).

### Mac OS Instructions for Installing Dependencies
On MacOS we need to install the latest version of [cmake](https://cmake.org/), and [ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) which can be done using Homebrew with (Docs for installing Homebrew: https://brew.sh).

```bash
brew install cmake ninja
```

### Clone the TT-MLIR Repo

1. Clone the tt-mlir repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-mlir.git
```

2. Navigate into the **tt-mlir** folder.

## Environment Setup

There are two ways to set up the environment:
* [Using a Docker Image](docker-notes.md#using-the-docker-image) - Please see [Docker Notes](docker-notes.md#using-the-docker-image) for details on how to set up and use the docker image. The Docker image is recommended since it is easier to set up and use.
* [Setting Up the Environment Manually](#setting-up-the-environment-manually) - This section focuses on this method. For instructions on how to use Docker, see the Docker Notes.

Topics covered in this section include:
* [Setting up the Environment Manually](#setting-up-the-environment-manually)
 * [Building the TT-MLIR Project](#building-the-tt-mlir-project)
 * [Testing the Build](#testing-the-build)

### Setting up the Environment Manually

This section explains how to manually build the environment so you can use tt-mlir. You only need to build this once, it builds llvm, flatbuffers, and a Python virtual environment. You can specify the LLVM build type by using `-DLLVM_BUILD_TYPE=*`. The default is `MinSizeRel`, and available options are listed [here](https://llvm.org/docs/CMake.html#frequently-used-cmake-variables).

1. Navigate into the **tt-mlir** folder.

2. The environment gets installed into a toolchain directory, which is by default set to `/opt/ttmlir-toolchain`, but can be overridden by setting (and persisting in your environment) the environment variable `TTMLIR_TOOLCHAIN_DIR`. You need to manually create the toolchain directory as follows:

```bash
export TTMLIR_TOOLCHAIN_DIR=/opt/ttmlir-toolchain/
sudo mkdir -p /opt/ttmlir-toolchain
sudo chown -R $USER /opt/ttmlir-toolchain
```

3. Please ensure that you do not already have an environment (venv) activated before running the following commands:

```bash
cmake -B env/build env
cmake --build env/build
source env/activate
```

> **NOTE:** The CMake commands take time to run, so give them time to complete.

#### Building the TT-MLIR Project

In this step, you build the tt-mlir project:

```bash
source env/activate
cmake -G Ninja -B build
cmake --build build
```
You have now configured TT-MLIR.

You can add different flags to your build. Here are some options to consider:

- To enable the ttnn/metal runtime add `-DTTMLIR_ENABLE_RUNTIME=ON`. Clang 17 is the minimum required version when enabling the runtime.
- To enable the ttnn/metal perf runtime add `-DTT_RUNTIME_ENABLE_PERF_TRACE=ON`.
- To accelerate the builds with ccache use `-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=ccache`.
- To workaround OOM issues it can be useful to decrease the number of parallel jobs with `-DCMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL=4`.
- If Python bindings aren't required for your project, you can accelerate builds further with the command `-DTTMLIR_ENABLE_BINDINGS_PYTHON=OFF`.
- To enable `tt-explorer` add the `-DTT_RUNTIME_ENABLE_PERF_TRACE=ON`, `-DTTMLIR_ENABLE_RUNTIME=ON`, and `-DTT_RUNTIME_DEBUG=ON`.
- To enable optimizer pass that uses the op model library, add `-DTTMLIR_ENABLE_OPMODEL=ON`.
- The TTNN build is automatically integrated / handled by the tt-mlir cmake build system. For debugging and further information regarding the TTNN backend build step, please refer to [TTNN Documentation](https://tenstorrent.github.io/tt-metal/latest/ttnn/ttnn/installing.html).
- The runtime build depends on the `TT_METAL_HOME` variable, which is also set in `env/activate` script. For more information, please refer to [TT-NN and TT-Metailium installation documentation](https://tenstorrent.github.io/tt-metal/latest/ttnn/ttnn/installing.html#step-4-install-and-start-using-tt-nn-and-tt-metalium).

| OS           | Offline Compiler Only | Runtime Enabled Build | Runtime + Perf Enabled Build |
| ------------ | --------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Ubuntu 22.04 | ✅                    | ✅                    | ✅                           |
| Ubuntu 20.04 | ✅                    | ❌                    | ❌                           |
| MacOS        | ✅                    | ❌                    | ❌                           |

#### Testing the Build

Use this step to check your build. Do the following:

```bash
source env/activate
cmake --build build -- check-ttmlir
```

## Lint

Set up lint so you can spot errors and stylistic issues before runtime:

```bash
source env/activate
cmake --build build -- clang-tidy
```

> **NOTE:** You can run:
> ```bash
> source env/activate
> cmake --build build -- clang-tidy-ci
> ```
>
> This reproduces the `Lint (clang-tidy)` CI job. It runs `clang-tidy` only on committed files that have been modified relative to the `origin/main` branch.

## Pre-commit
Pre-commit applies a git hook to the local repository such that linting is checked and applied on every `git commit` action. Install from the root of the repository using:

```bash
source env/activate
pre-commit install
```

If you have already committed before installing the pre-commit hooks, you can run on all files to "catch up":

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

For more information visit [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/).

## Building the Docs

Build the documentation by doing the following:

1. Make sure you have `mdbook`, `doxygen`, `sphinx`, and `sphinx-markdown-builder` installed.

2. Build the docs:

```bash
source env/activate
cmake --build build -- docs
mdbook serve build/docs
```

> **NOTE:** `mdbook serve` will by default create a local server at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Common Build Errors

#### `TTMLIRPythonCAPI target requires changing an RPATH`

```
CMake Error at /opt/ttmlir-toolchain/lib/cmake/llvm/AddLLVM.cmake:594 (add_library):
 The install of the TTMLIRPythonCAPI target requires changing an RPATH from
 the build tree, but this is not supported with the Ninja generator unless
 on an ELF-based or XCOFF-based platform. The CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH variable may be set to avoid this relinking
 step.
```

If you get the above error, it means you tried to build with an old version of cmake or ninja and there is a stale file. To fix this, `rm -rf` your build directory, install a newer version of cmake/ninja, and then rebuild. If you installed ninja via `sudo apt install ninja-build`, it might still be not up-to-date (v1.10.0). You may use ninja in the python virtual environment, or install it via `pip3 install -U ninja`, either way the version `1.11.1.git.kitware.jobserver-1` should work.

#### `clang++ is not a full path and was not found in the PATH`

```
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:2 (project):
 The CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER:
   clang++
 is not a full path and was not found in the PATH.
 Tell CMake where to find the compiler by setting either the environment
 variable "CXX" or the CMake cache entry CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER to the full path
 to the compiler, or to the compiler name if it is in the PATH.
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:2 (project):
 The CMAKE_C_COMPILER:
   clang
 is not a full path and was not found in the PATH.
 Tell CMake where to find the compiler by setting either the environment
 variable "CC" or the CMake cache entry CMAKE_C_COMPILER to the full path to
 the compiler, or to the compiler name if it is in the PATH.
```

If you get the following error, it means you need to install clang which you can do with `sudo apt install clang` on Ubuntu.

#### TT-Metal Update Failures

```
Failed to unstash changes in: '/path/to/tt-metal/src/tt-metal'
You will have to resolve the conflicts manually
```

This error occurs during CMake's ExternalProject update of TT-Metal. The build system tries to apply changes using Git's stash mechanism, but fails due to conflicts. This can happen even if you haven't manually modified any files, as the build process itself may leave behind artifacts or partial changes from previous builds.

To resolve, run the following command:

```bash
rm -rf third_party/tt-metal
```

Then retry your build command. If the error persists, you may need to do the following:

1. Remove the build directory: `rm -rf build`

2. Run CMake commands again.

3. Run the above.

## Common Runtime Errors

### Debugging Python on Mac OS

When debugging python on macOS via lldb you may see an error like:

```
(lldb) r
error: process exited with status -1 (attach failed (Not allowed to attach to process.  Look in the console messages (Console.app), near the debugserver entries, when the attach failed.  The subsystem that denied t
he attach permission will likely have logged an informative message about why it was denied.))
```

For preinstalled macOS binaries you must manually codesign with debug entitlements.


Create file `debuggee-entitlement.xml`:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
       <key>com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation</key>
       <true/>
       <key>com.apple.security.get-task-allow</key>
       <true/>
</dict>
</plist>
```

Sign the binary:

```bash
sudo codesign -f -s - --entitlements debuggee-entitlement.xml /opt/ttmlir-toolchain/venv/bin/python
```
