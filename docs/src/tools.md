# Tools

Currently, there are a few primary tools that are part of the `ttmlir` project:

- `ttmlir-opt`: The `ttmlir` optimizer driver.  This tool is used to run the `ttmlir` compiler passes on a `.mlir` source files and is central to developing and testing the compiler.
- `ttrt`: This tool is intended to be a swiss army knife for working with flatbuffers generated by the compiler.  Its primary role is to inspect and run flatbuffer files.
- [`tt-explorer`](https://github.com/vprajapati-tt/tt-explorer): Visualizer tool for `ttmlir`-powered compiler results. Visualizes from emitted `.mlir` files to display compiled model, attributes, performance results, and provide a platform for human-driven overrides to _gameify_ model tuning.
