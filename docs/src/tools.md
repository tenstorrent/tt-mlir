# Tools

Currently, there are a few primary tools that are part of the `ttmlir` project:

- [`ttmlir-opt`](./ttmlir-opt.md): The `ttmlir` optimizer driver.  This tool is used to run the `ttmlir` compiler passes on a `.mlir` source files and is central to developing and testing the compiler.
- [`ttmlir-translate`](./ttmlir-translate.md): The `ttmlir` translation tool. This tool can convert from IR to external representation (and inverse). For example, IR in EmitC dialect can be converted into C++ code.
- [`ttrt`](./ttrt.md): This tool is intended to be a swiss army knife for working with flatbuffers generated by the compiler.  Its primary role is to inspect and run flatbuffer files.
- [`ttir-builder`] (./ttir-builder.md): This tool is for creating ttir operations. It provides support for those ops to be compiled into modules or directly to flatbuffer files.
- [`tt-explorer`](./tt-explorer.md): Visualizer tool for `ttmlir`-powered compiler results. Visualizes from emitted `.mlir` files to display compiled model, attributes, performance results, and provide a platform for human-driven overrides to _gameify_ model tuning.
- [`ttnn-standalone`](./ttnn-standalone.md): This tool is used to run C++ TTNN code outside of the compiler environment.
