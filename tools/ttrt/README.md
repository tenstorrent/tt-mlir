# `ttrt`

This tool is intended to be a swiss army knife for working with flatbuffers generated by the compiler.  Its primary role is to inspect and run flatbuffer files.  It enables the running of flatbuffer files without a front-end runtime.

## Building
```bash
source env/activate
cmake --build build
ttrt --help
```

## Installing ttrt as python whls
Every time `ttrt` is built, it creates a whls file in `build/tools/ttrt/build`. Ex filename: `ttrt-0.0.235-cp311-cp311-linux_x86_64.whl`. You can take this whls file and install it in any docker container and in any venv outside of ttmlir. After which, you can use all the following functionality as the same.
1. Download whls
2. Create a python venv
```bash
python -m venv ttrt_env
source ttrt_env/bin/activate
```
3. Install whls (replace with your version of the whls)
```bash
pip install ttrt-0.0.235-cp311-cp311-linux_x86_64.whl
```

## Usage
To get started, refer to `ttrt` [documentation](../../../docs/src/ttrt.md).
