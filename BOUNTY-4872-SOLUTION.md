# Solution for Issue #4872

[Bounty $100] Compare ops

## Implementation
---SOLUTION---
Implement the comparison operations by adding appropriate patterns and logic in `StableHLOToTTIRPatterns.cpp`. Ensure that each operation (e.g., compare, select) is correctly mapped to its corresponding TTIR representation. Test cases should be updated or created to cover these new ops.
