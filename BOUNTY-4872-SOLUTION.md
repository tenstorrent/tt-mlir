# Solution for Issue #4872

## Summary
[Bounty $100] Compare ops

## Implementation
Implement the comparison operations (e.g., `stablehlo.compare`) by adding necessary patterns and logic in `StableHLOToTTIRPatterns.cpp`. Ensure that each operation is correctly mapped to its corresponding TTMLIR representation. Test cases should cover all edge cases for comparison ops.
